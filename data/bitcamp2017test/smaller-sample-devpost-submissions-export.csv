Everyone has, at some point, tried and failed to edit a Wikipedia article. There's a reason not just anyone can make changes - or else anarchy would ensue, right? Well... hmmm ....

What it does

Anarchypedia allows users to anonymously view, edit and save Wikipedia articles.

How I built it

Anarchypedia is a simple CRUD (or, rather, CRU) web app built with Django on the back end. When a user searches for a previously non-Anarchypedia-ed article, the article's original content is queried from the Wikipedia API in XML. The main body (not including subheaders) of the article is then extracted from the XML as raw HTML and saved into the database with other relevant metadata. The user is then presented with the article.
When editing an article, the user is manipulating the HTML saved from earlier (I would've liked to have the user edit in WikiCode or some other markup language, but then I'd end up parsing HTML with regex).

Challenges I ran into


Matching Wikipedia's styling and fonts was a pain
Deploying this app was a pain


Accomplishments that I'm proud of


Managed to finish minimum viable product by the end of night 1 and go Maryland sightseeing :)


What I learned


Parsing  XML with Python
Django 2.0
Deploying with PythonAnywhere


What's next for Anarchypedia

What's next is a laundry list of polishing:


Random anarchy-ed article link on sidebar
Search bar on base template
Match fonts and styling more closely
Responsive design
Fetch/Save full Wikipedia articles instead of only main content
Full edit history tracking

Becorum - Robust Universal Mobility App,http://bitcamp2018.devpost.com/submissions/92182-becorum-robust-universal-mobility-app,"Inspiration

A smarter way to travel and connect user to robust, organized and universal mobility throughout the US.

What it does

It's an android app that gives user the ability to purchase local bus passes in app, using NFC to manage cashless payments, making it easier across the board to get from point A to point B without the worry of a paper pass.

The app also determines the cheapest and most efficient travel routes for users.

How I built it

Android Studio, Java, XML, MongoDB

Challenges I ran into

We ran into installs and overcoming the learning curve of Android Studio.

What's next for Becorum

Continue as a startup project.
